# Power-System-Fault-Detection-and-Classification
This project uses machine learning to detect and classify power system faults based on voltage and current data. A Random Forest model analyzes patterns to identify fault types quickly, improving grid reliability. The system is deployed with an interactive Streamlit dashboard for visualization.
